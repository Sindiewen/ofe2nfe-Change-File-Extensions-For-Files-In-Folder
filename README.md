# ofe2nfe: Change File Extensions For Files In Folder
This shell script I made is for changing all files in a directory from their old file extention to a new file extension.

I made this so I don't need to manually change file extension's for each file if I have a ton of files.


How to use:
1. Copy the .sh file to your desired directory
2. run command through your bash shell in that directory './ofe2nfe .old .new' with .old being the old file extension, and .new being the new file extension
3.  ???
4.  Profit
